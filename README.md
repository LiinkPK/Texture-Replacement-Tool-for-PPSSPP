## Setup

1. Click **+ Add Game Folder** in the left sidebar.
2. Navigate to your PPSSPP textures folder, e.g.:
   `Documents\PPSSPP\PSP\TEXTURES\ULES01505`
3. Give it a display name (e.g. "Dissidia 012 EUR").
4. Game's `texture.ini` and its folder will be loaded when selecting the game.

> **Make sure "textures.ini" is inside that folder or else appending won't work as intented.**

---

## Adding a texture replacement

1. Select the **original texture PNG** — this is the file extracted from the game.
2. Select the **replacement texture PNG** — your new HD version.
3. Select or load your **textures.ini** file.
4. Choose a **Category** and **Sub-Category** if applicable.
5. Click **Append to textures.ini**.

The entry will be written in the correct format and sorted alphabetically within its section.

---

## It is very important to **NOT** rename the original file.

It should maintain its hexadecimal string for the replacement to work.

**Example:**

>If the filename is `0000000000000000668a48bc.png` do not change it to `AerithTexture_old.png` or PPSSPP will not overwrite it.

## textures.ini format

PPSSPP identifies textures using only the last 8 digits of their hash code. The tool automatically formats the entry so only those 8 digits are written to the .ini file.
The tool uses `#` for top-level categories and `##` for sub-categories:
```
#Characters
##Aerith
0000000000000000668a48bc = Characters/Aerith/AerithMenuPort.png

#JobCards
00000000000000000e58e631 = JobCards/WhiteMage.png
```

---

## PPSSPP Settings

After appending the entries to the .ini file, make sure `texture replacement` is enabled in PPSSPP:

`Settings > Tools > Developer tools > Texture replacement > Replace textures`

> **Compatibility:** While this tool was built specifically for Dissidia 012, it may work with other PSP games that use a similar texture replacement setup.
