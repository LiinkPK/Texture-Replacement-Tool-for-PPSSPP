## textures.ini format

PPSSPP identifies textures using only the last 8 digits of their hash code. The tool automatically formats the entry so only those 8 digits are written to the .ini file.
The tool uses `#` for top-level categories and `##` for sub-categories:
```
#Characters
##Aerith
0000000000000000668a48bc = Characters/Aerith/AerithMenuPort.png

#JobCards
00000000000000000e58e631 = JobCards/WhiteMage.png
```

## PPSSPP Settings

After appending the entries to the .ini file, make sure `texture replacement` is enabled in PPSSPP:

`Settings > Tools > Developer tools > Texture replacement > Replace textures`
